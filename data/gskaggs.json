                "back": "The FBI developed their negotiation methods through iteration while having intense skin in the game.\u00a0Harvard intellectuals did so through theory. Consequently, the FBI methods were superior.\nVoss asks the same open ended questions until they get frustrated and give up\nGood negotiator know they need to be ready for surprises. Great negotiators use their skills to reveal the surprises they're certain exist.\u00a0\nYour mindset should be that of discovery. Learn as much about the situation as possible\nYes can be inauthentic. When you say No, you know you're in control and not just being taken for a ride. For example, always ask \"is now a bad time?\u201d Instead of \u201cis now a good time?\" If you get a *no* you know the person is going to be focused and not just distractedly playing along.\nIn general, *that's right* is what you\u2019re looking for. It signals your counterpart believes they\u2019ve come up with the solution themselves. Alternatively, *you're right* is bad and often dismissive.\nUse your opponent's deadlines against them. Cars salesman are more likely to give good deals at end of the month, businessmen at end of the financial quarter.\nAvoid anchoring (giving the first offer) in monetary bargaining. But beware of sharks who will give a ludicrous anchor to throw you off.\nIn a job interview or salary negotiation, ask \"what does it take to be successful here.\" That'll give the boss a personal stake in your success. You've just created an unofficial mentor\nWho has control in a negotiation the talker or the listener? The listener of course. That's because the talker is revealing information.",
